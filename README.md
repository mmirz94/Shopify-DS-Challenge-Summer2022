# Shopify-DS-Challenge-Summer2022

This repository contains my solution for the Shopify's Summer 2022 Data Science internship.

* This app can be deployed to Heroku and a deployed version can be found [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/shopify-ds-summer-2022)
* [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction) framework was used for developing this report.
* dash_charts is a custom dash component that I have built on top of [React's Google charts](https://www.react-google-charts.com/). This component has a cool 3D pie_chart which you cannot find in the plotly library.
